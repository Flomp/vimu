Within the realm of vimu's extensive node collection, it's not uncommon to encounter situations where a specific application doesn't align with any available nodes. This is precisely where vimu's plugin system steps in, offering a practical solution to cater to diverse needs.

The plugin system serves as a versatile platform that allows you to fashion new nodes according to your requirements. Whether you're addressing a particular use case or exploring innovative ideas, the plugin system provides a framework for customization and adaptation. This flexibility enables you to create nodes with tailored logic, and you can choose to use them within your projects or share them with the wider user community.

At the core of the plugin system lies the plugin editor - a tool that provides ample room for customization. Through this editor, you can adjust inputs, outputs, and controls to fine-tune the behavior of your nodes. This adaptability allows you to create nodes ranging from simple operations to more intricate processes, seamlessly integrating them into your projects.

vimu's plugin system is based on Python as the scripting language. This choice offers familiarity and convenience for those already acquainted with Python programming. Transferring your existing code to vimu becomes straightforward, enabling you to swiftly develop and enhance your plugin nodes.
