# General

Accounts are how a user interacts with **vimu**.
Accounts currently are linked to one email or one Google account. Every account has a unique username that is generated upon creation. To open the account settings click your avatar in the top right corner and select "Account".

## Account actions
### Change your username
Your username is how other people can find you (e.g. to <nuxt-link to="/docs/dashboard/files#sharing">share a file</nuxt-link>). You can change your username at any time. Please note that a username has to be unique. You will get an error message if you try to change your username to one that is already taken.

### Change your email address
Similarly, you can change your email address. After saving, a confirmation email will be sent to the new address. Only by clicking the link provided in the email, the address will be permanently changed.

If you used Google to authenticate this option is not available.

### Update avatar
If you do not like your avatar you can generate a new one by clicking the <i class="v-icon mdi mdi-cached theme--light"></i> icon next to your current avatar.

### Update your email preferences
In this section, you can determine in which cases you like to be notified by **vimu**. Just tick or untick the boxes to suite your preferences.

### Delete account
At the bottom of the page, you can select "Delete Account" to have all your account and data related to your account deleted. This action cannot be undone. 

After successful confirmation, **vimu** deletes all account information & files and removes your account from all email lists. We are fully compliant with EU GDPRâ€™s data removal provisions.
