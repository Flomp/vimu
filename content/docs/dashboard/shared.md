# Shared Files

<nuxt-link to="/docs/dashboard/files">Files</nuxt-link> that have been <nuxt-link to="/docs/dashboard/files#sharing">shared</nuxt-link> with you will be listed in this section of the dashboard.

## Access rights
Depending on how the file owner shared the file with you, a shared file can have two different levels of access rights.

### Read-only
You can only view the file, but you cannot edit it. Any changes you make will not be propagated to other users. In the editor's title, the file name is suffixed with "(read-only)".

### Full access
The owner of the file has granted you full access to the file. Any changes you make will be saved and will be visible to the owner and every other collaborator.

## Real-time updates

Changes to a file are updated in real-time. This means that a change is instantly visible to everyone that is currently working on the file. This allows for any number of collaborators to work on the same file simultaneously. You will see an avatar icon at the top of the node panel for every collaborator that is currently editing or viewing the same file as you.
