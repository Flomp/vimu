The dashboard is your central hub for **vimu**. From here you can access all of your <nuxt-link to="/docs/dashboard/files">files</nuxt-link>, <nuxt-link to="/docs/dashboard/shared">shared files</nuxt-link> and <nuxt-link to="/docs/dashboard/scores">scores</nuxt-link> via the sidebar. You can reach it by clicking the "Dashboard" button on the main page. Or by clicking on your profile avatar in the top right corner and selecting "Dashboard" from the dropdown menu.
