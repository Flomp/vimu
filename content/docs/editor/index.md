# Editor

<framed-gif path="/imgs/editor.png"></framed-gif>

The editor is your main workbench. Here you build, create, observe the output of your analysis, and much more. To get here create a <nuxt-link to="/docs/dashboard/files#create-a-file">new file</nuxt-link> or open an existing one.

The editor is split into three view panels by default.
### Node panel
On the very left, you find the node panel. It will be your main workspace. Here you can add nodes and connect them to analyse the score in the way you want.
### Output panel
In the middle, the output panel is located. The final result of the output node will be displayed here. It can either be a score or a plot.
### Details panel
On the right, you see the details panel. In there you can get detailed information about a node you have selected.

You can find a detailed article on each panel in this documentation.

## Saving
Any changes you make to the file in the editor are automatically saved. There is no need to save manually. If you would like to save the file you are working on to your hard drive, you can do so from the <nuxt-link to="/docs/editor/menu#export">file menu</nuxt-link>.
